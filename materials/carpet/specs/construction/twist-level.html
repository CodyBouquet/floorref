        Carpet Twist Level, Explained

          Twist Rate • Twists Per Inch (TPI) • Heat-Set Yarn • Texture Retention

      </h1>

      <p class="text-slate-700 text-lg max-w-3xl">
        Twist level is a “why does this carpet look worn?” spec—especially for <span class="font-semibold">cut-pile</span> carpets.
        Yarn that holds its twist tends to keep a cleaner look longer, while low-twist yarn can open up, fuzz, and show traffic more quickly.
        This page explains twist level (TPI) in plain English and how to read it without treating it like a single magic number.

        <p class="mt-2 text-slate-800">
          <span class="font-semibold">Twist level</span> (twist rate) describes how tightly carpet yarn is twisted, often listed as
          <span class="font-semibold">twists per inch (TPI)</span>.
          Higher twist and a stable <span class="font-semibold">heat-set</span> can improve how well cut-pile carpet resists fraying, untwisting,
          and “mushy” traffic-lane appearance. Twist is most meaningful when compared within similar pile styles and paired with density.

    <!-- What -->
    <section id="what" class="mt-10 space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What Twist Level Means</h2>

      <div class="rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-sm">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Twist = how tightly the yarn strands are wound</h3>
        <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
          Carpet yarn is made by twisting filaments together. That twist changes how the yarn behaves:
          tighter twist generally makes the yarn more compact and less likely to open up at the tip.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3 text-slate-700">
          Twist level is most commonly used to describe <span class="font-semibold">cut-pile</span> carpets
          (like saxony and many friezes) where the yarn tips are exposed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-sm">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Heat-set = helping the twist “stay set”</h3>
        <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
          Many carpets use a heat-setting process to lock the twist in.
          “Heat-set yarn” generally means the twist is stabilized so the yarn is less likely to untwist during use.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Why -->
    <section id="why" class="mt-10 space-y-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Why Twist Level Matters</h2>

      <div class="rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-sm">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Texture retention (how “new” it keeps looking)</h3>
        <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
          In cut-pile carpets, the yarn tips take the wear. Lower twist yarn can open up and look fuzzy or “bloomed”
          in traffic areas. Higher twist can help the yarn tips stay tighter and resist that change.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-sm">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Fuzzing and tip definition</h3>
        <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
          Twist doesn’t prevent every kind of fuzzing, but tighter twist can reduce the tendency for yarn ends to fray and spread.
          This is one reason higher-twist styles are often chosen for more active homes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-sm">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Comfort and “look” tradeoffs</h3>
        <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
          Some very soft, plush-feeling carpets intentionally use lower twist or different constructions to achieve a certain feel.
          Twist is part of a design tradeoff: higher twist can look more textured or tailored, while lower twist can feel plusher.
        </p>
      </div>

    <!-- TPI -->
    <section id="tpi" class="mt-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">How Twist Is Listed (TPI) and How to Read It</h2>

      <div class="mt-4 grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2">
        <div class="rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Twists per inch (TPI)</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
            Some spec sheets list twist as TPI. Higher TPI generally means tighter twist.
            Not every residential listing includes TPI, but it’s more common in technical specs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Compare within the same pile style</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
            Twist is most meaningful when comparing similar cut-pile constructions.
            Comparing a frieze to a plush saxony using only twist isn’t apples-to-apples.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Pair twist with density</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
            Twist helps yarn tips hold up, while <span class="font-semibold">density</span> helps support the pile overall.
            A high-twist carpet that’s very low density can still crush and show traffic.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Watch for “heat-set” language</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
            If the specs mention heat-set yarn, it’s a signal the twist has been stabilized.
            The exact process varies, but conceptually it’s about keeping the yarn from untwisting during use.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="mt-6 rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-sm">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Common misconception: “Twist = durability score”</h3>
        <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">
          Twist is an important input for cut-pile texture retention, but it doesn’t replace other durability factors like
          density, fiber resilience, backing system, and installation quality.

          <p class="mt-3 text-slate-700">
            Twist is most commonly used to evaluate cut-pile carpets because the yarn ends are exposed.
            Loop piles can still use twisted yarns, but performance and appearance are more influenced by loop construction and density.

          </summary>
          <p class="mt-3 text-slate-700">
            Many ultra-soft looks use constructions that prioritize feel and plushness, which can mean lower twist or different yarn behavior.
            That doesn’t make them “bad,” but it can change how quickly traffic lanes show in appearance.

          <p class="mt-3 text-slate-700">
            Not at all. Many consumer-facing listings just don’t publish TPI.
            You can still evaluate texture retention using pile style, density, and practical use expectations.
